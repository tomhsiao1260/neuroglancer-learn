## How to run

Generate a zarr folder called `scroll.zarr` in the root directory. Then, `npm install`. Now open a server via `python cors_webserver.py` command to serve the zarr content at `localhost:9000`. Once finished, run `npm run dev-server` to start the app. Hopefully you can see the volume data on it.
